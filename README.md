# alien-pygame
A short-term project with ample overview to make an alien shooting game.

1. This [main program](https://github.com/danujs/alien-pygame/blob/main/alien.py), alien.py, is created to make the spaceship appear on the screen. Additionally, this file imports the library from settings.py to build the game screen and showcase the ship using a rectangular pixel in the ship.py
2. This [ship.py](https://github.com/danujs/alien-pygame/blob/main/ship.py) program allows the codes to load the chosen bitmap image (.bmp), which will initially be shown at the middle bottom of the screen.
